You can use multiple values in a WHERE clause via IN Operator
--in example

  select first_name,last_name,salary from hr.employees where manager_id IN (100,200,300);

  select first_name,last_name,salary from hr.employees where department_id in (20,30,40);

--between
BETWEEN operator is used in the Where Clause and it is used to select values within a given range.
-- between example
  select first_name,last_name,salary from hr.employees where department_id BETWEEN 100 AND 500;
  
  select first_name,last_name,salary from hr.employees where salary between 15000 and 25000;
