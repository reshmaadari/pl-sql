Data types are used to represent the nature of the data that can be stored in the database table. For example, in a particular column of a table, 
if we want to store a string type of data then we will have to declare a string data type of this column.

A Data Type defines the type of data that can be stored in a table column.Examples include: integer, date, money, string, decimal, binary, and others.
SQL Server data types fall into five categories.

Numeric
Date and Time
Character and String
Binary
Miscellaneous
