A database connection is a SQL Developer object that specifies the necessary information for connecting to a specific database, as a specific user of that database. 
You must have at least one database connection (existing, created, or imported) to use SQL Developer. To create a database connection , perform the following steps:
-> In a terminal window, set the environment variable. Change directories to the sqldeveloper directory under $ORACLE_HOME. 
Invoke SQL Developer by executing the sh sqldeveloper.sh command.
-> In the Connections navigator, right-click the Connections node and select New Connection.
-> Enter a connection name of your choice, username of system and password for the SYSTEM user. Select "Save Password" if you want to save your password for future connections as this user. 
Accept the default connection type and role. Enter the hostname, port, and SID. You can click Test to ensure that the connection works correctly. Click Connect.
-> Your connection is displayed in the Connections tab on the left side and a SQL worksheet is opened automatically.
