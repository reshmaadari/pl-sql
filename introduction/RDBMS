-> A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 
-> Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. 
-> In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. 
-> The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.
-> A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update,administer and 
otherwise interact with a relational database. RDBMSes store data in the form of tables, with most commercial relational database management systems using
-> Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database. However, since SQL was invented after the initial development of the relational model, it is not 
necessary for RDBMS use.
-> The RDBMS is the most popular database system among organizations across the world. It provides a dependable method of storing and retrieving large amounts
of data while offering a combination of system performance and ease of implementation.
->An RDBMS is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores data in a row-based table structure which connects related data elements. An RDBMS includes
functions that maintain the security, accuracy, integrity and consistency of the data. This is different than the file storage used in a DBMS.A relational database management system (RDBMS or just RDB) is a common type of database that stores data in tables, so it can be used in relation to other 
stored datasets
