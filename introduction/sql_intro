SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.
SQL lets you access and manipulate databases.
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987
SQL can execute queries against a database, retrieve data from a database, insert, update records in a database, delete records from a database create new databases.
SQL commands can be categorized into five categories based on their functionality. They are as follows:
DDL – Data Definition Language
DML – Data Manipulation Language
DCL – Data Control Language
TCL – Transaction Control Language
DQL – Data Query Language

Data Definition Language(DDL)    : DDL commands are used for creating and altering the database and database object in the relational database management system, 
                                   like CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc. The most used DDL commands are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE.
                           
Data Manipulation Language(DML)  : DML commands are used for manipulating data in a relational database management system. DML commands are used for adding, removing, 
                                   updating data in the database system, like INSERT INTO TableName, DELETE FROM TableName, UPDATE tableName set data, etc.
                                   The most used DML commands are INSERT INTO, DELETE FROM, UPDATE. 

Data Control Language(DCL)       : DCL commands are used for providing and taking back the access rights on the database and database objects. DCL command used for 
                                   controlling user’s access on the data. Most used DCL commands are GRANT and REVOKE.
                            
Transaction Control Language(TCL): TCL commands are used for handling transactions in the database. Transactions ensure data integrity in the multi-user environment. 
                                   TCL commands can rollback and commit data modification in the database. The most used TCL commands are COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, and SET TRANSACTION.

                                
Data Query Language(DQL)         :  DQL command is used for fetching the data. DQL command is used for selecting data from the table, view, temp table, table variable, etc. 
                                    There is only one command under DQL which is the SELECT command.
