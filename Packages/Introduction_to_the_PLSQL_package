A package is a schema object that groups PL/SQL types, variables,
constants, subprograms, cursors, and exceptions based on their logical 
relationships. A package is assembled and saved in the database, where
it can be shared by numerous apps.

A specification that lists the public elements that can be referred 
to from outside the package is always present in a package.


Cursors or other subprograms must be present in the package if the 
public items do. The body must specify the code for public subprograms 
and public cursor queries. The body may additionally declare and 
define private objects that are required for the proper operation
of the package but which cannot be referenced from outside the package.
